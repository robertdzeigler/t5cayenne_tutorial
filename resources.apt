* Resources Files

	The only file currently under "resources" is "log4j.properties".  However, we will come back to resources to store our "component templates" (more on those later).  Internally, tapestry codes to the {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}sl4j}} logging interfaces.  In theory, you could then use whatever logging api ({{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html}log4j}}, {{{http://logback.qos.ch/}logback}}, {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html}java.util.logging}}) you desire.  The quickstart archetype, however, uses log4j.  The mode of configuring logging is therefore a configuration file, typically a "properties file" (key=value).  Thus, log4j.properties is the logging configuration file where we can turn logging on or off for the application as a whole or any piece of the application, specifically.  If you haven't used good logging software before, I recommend checking out either {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html}log4j}} or its successor, {{{http://logback.qos.ch/}logback}}, to get the most of out of your logging.  EXPLAIN LOG4J CONFIG FILE?  

	Before discussing the files under src/main/java, we need to take some time to discuss {{{app_structure.html}the application structure of a tapestry 5 webapp}}.
